methods: "For each state our scenario projections are generated using an age/risk stratified mechanistic model with S[Sv]E[Ev]I[Iv]HR compartments, where 'v' subscripts indicate vaccinated. The model is calibrated to the 2023-24 data, and extrapolated through the 2024-25 season."
methods_long: "We use the population and vaccine time series provided by the Scenario Hub and 
  \ assume that the infection-susceptibility of vaccinated individuals accounts for one half \
  \ of vaccine effectiveness against severe disease. The model is calibrated to 2023-24 season adult \
  \ and pediatric COVID hospital admissions, employing a flexible time-dependent transmission term. \
  \ Calibration assumes that last season fell somewhere between scenarios E and F. \
  \ Additionally, calibration includes a preference for periodic/quasi-periodic trajectories. \
  \ Calibration is a two-stage process.  The first stage uses a traditional optimizer to find a \
  \ centroid for the hyper-cube used in the second stage. \
  \ The national projection profiles are calculated as \
  \ the sum of states using semi-randomly ordered state level profiles. "\
